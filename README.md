# Flashcards (For Language Learning) # 

This projects is meant to provide a platform for language learning students with the opportunity 
of enhancing their learning through active recall by using falsh cards. This is tailored towards 
Language learning in that it offers the opportunity to not only to learn the translation of words 
but also to test your knowledge of the gender(incases of gendered languages). 

This project is important to me because I am a language learner my self. However learning language
as grown up take a lot of effort and commitement but with the help of this app I hope to make the process 
easier for me and from my fellow language learning community.

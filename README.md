This projects is meant to provide a platform for language learning students with the opportunity 
of enhancing their learning through active recall by using falsh cards.

This project is special to me because I am passionate about learning languages. However, I understand that it takes a lot of effort and commitement. Therefore I am hopeful that with the help of this app the process will be made easier for me and my fellow language learning community.

# User Stories

As a user I want to be able to: 

1. Add and remove Words from a deck
2. Categorize my deck into the language of the new word.
3. Categorize my deck into level of difficulty such as Easy and Hard
4. Track my engagement with the material
5. Have difficulty increase based on correctness 
6. Choose between a score quiz or Speced repetion quiz

## What Will make this project better

1. A user being able to form their own categories, such as (Food, Car parts), since this will allow them to learn a variety of vocabularies in specific contexts

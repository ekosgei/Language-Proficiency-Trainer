# Flashcards (For Language Learning) # 

This projects is meant to provide a platform for language learning students with the opportunity 
of enhancing their learning through active recall by using falsh cards. This is tailored towards 
Language learning in that it offers the opportunity to not only learn the translation of words 
but also the gender of a word (in cases of gendered languages). 

This project is important to me because I am passionate about learning languages. However, I understand thatit takes a lot of effort and commitement. Therefore I am hopeful that with the help of this app the process will be made easier for me and my fellow language learning community.
